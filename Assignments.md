Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile is flexible, allowing changes as the project progresses; however, it may lead to scope changes and potential delays.
Waterfall is structured with clear stages but is less adaptable to change. It’s suitable for well-defined projects but risks inflexibility if requirements shift.
In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is better for projects with evolving requirements, like a new mobile app.
Waterfall suits projects with fixed requirements, like accounting software for a specific process.
